A recipe finder app using The Meal DB Free API.

What the app does:

1 - A user can search their favourite food and the API will display whatever it has available.

2 - Once the image of the food has been clicked on, the user receives further information on what is required to make the meal as well as the ingredients listed below.

What was the goal of this project?

To be able to understand how to work with multiple API endpoints and display data based on what the user has searched for as well as trying to resolve issues dealing with a messier API.

What were the problems I encountered?

Making sure that for the ingredients that were not listed as part of the API, that it doesn't show a '-'. But instead shows nothing.

Also, the e.path method didn't work within Firefox, but the e.path method worked within Opera & Chrome instead since Firefox didn't support this as I discovered here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39245488/event-path-is-undefined-running-in-firefox.
